  # to make the build work through rollup with DID logic (https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-verifier-js/pull/1257)
  # we are aliasing readable-stream to https://github.com/exogee-technology/readable-stream
  # however this breaks semantic release because the shape of the export is different
  # so we install the regular version of readable stream to enable expected use by semantic release
  # it is an inelegant patch but it's a quick solution to the problem and is acceptable as it is the last step of the CI
